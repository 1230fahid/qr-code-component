## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
In this project I learned practiced my CSS skills a bit. I was familiar with flexbox but wanted to practice it. Also wanted to practice speed and efficiency. I'm not sure if this would even be a 10/10 design but I'm curious to know how I'll be graded as well. I did get to practice more with semantic HTML. Usually I just use divs which I know is bad practice, so I'm trying to fix that.


I need to focus on getting better at CSS before I pick up stuff like Tailwind. I still don't know what Styled Components are so I definitely need to learn it as well. Also in general, I need to get more familiar with media queries. 

### Useful resources

- In general, I find w3schools.com to be an extremely helpful resource.
